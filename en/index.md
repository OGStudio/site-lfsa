## Overview

Local File System Access (LFSA) is a data provider for Client Side Web (CSW) apps.

LFSA was created to allow web browser application access local file system.

CSW apps run solely on your device, they are not related to cloud solution in any way.

CSW apps use LFSA to keep data at your hard drive, so you have complete control of your data.

Since CSW apps run on your device, nobody can pull the plug on you.
